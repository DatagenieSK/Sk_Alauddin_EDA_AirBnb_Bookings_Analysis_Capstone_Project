# Airbnb Bookings Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my Airbnb Bookings Analysis project! This is my individual capstone project where I explored data from Airbnb listings in New York City to find useful insights. Check it out!

## Project Overview
- **What I Did**: I analyzed a dataset with over 48,000 Airbnb listings from 2019 in NYC. The goal was to help Airbnb improve guest experiences, find new growth areas, support hosts, and set better prices.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in Google Colab.
- **Date**: Created on February 26, 2025.
- **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/DatagenieSK/Sk_Alauddin_EDA_AirBnb_Bookings_Analysis_Capstone_Project](https://github.com/DatagenieSK/Sk_Alauddin_EDA_AirBnb_Bookings_Analysis_Capstone_Project)

## Dataset
- The data has 48,895 rows and 16 columns, including:
  - `id`, `name`, `host_id`, `host_name`
  - `neighbourhood_group`, `neighbourhood`, `latitude`, `longitude`
  - `room_type`, `price`, `minimum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`
  - `last_review`, `reviews_per_month`, `calculated_host_listings_count`, `availability_365`
- I cleaned the data and made charts to understand it better.

## Key Findings
- **Customer Preferences**: Brooklyn is the most popular area, Manhattan is priciest, and entire homes are the top choice.
- **Growth Opportunities**: Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn are growing, and Queens has room to expand.
- **Host Insights**: Some hosts are super active, but many listings have no reviews.
- **Pricing**: Prices peak in winter (October-January), and entire homes cost more.

## Recommendations
- **For Guests**: Target budget travelers in the Bronx, mid-range in Williamsburg, luxury in Manhattan, and families in Greenwich Village. Add personalized suggestions and encourage reviews.
- **For Growth**: Promote Staten Island and Queens with host support and more listings.
- **For Hosts**: Offer education, rewards for top hosts, and help for new ones.
- **For Pricing**: Teach hosts about trends, test dynamic pricing, and use data for smart decisions.
